# Technology Scanning

This document describes the technology-detection scan that fingerprints the
software stack used by government websites catalogued in TOON seed files.

---

## Overview

The technology scanner fetches each government page and uses
[python-Wappalyzer](https://github.com/chorsley/python-Wappalyzer) to identify
technologies from HTTP response headers and HTML content.  Detected
technologies (CMS, web server, JavaScript frameworks, analytics, etc.) and
their versions are stored in the metadata database and written back into an
annotated `*_tech.toon` TOON file.

---

## Usage

### Scan a single country

```bash
python3 -m src.cli.scan_technology --country ICELAND --rate-limit 2
```

### Scan all countries

```bash
python3 -m src.cli.scan_technology --all --rate-limit 2
```

### Command-line options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--country CODE` | — | Country code to scan (e.g. `FRANCE`, `ICELAND`) |
| `--all` | — | Scan all countries in the TOON directory |
| `--toon-dir PATH` | `data/toon-seeds/countries` | Directory with `.toon` seed files |
| `--rate-limit N` | `2.0` | Maximum HTTP requests per second |

---

## GitHub Actions

The **Scan Technology Stack** workflow (`.github/workflows/scan-technology.yml`)
can be triggered manually from the Actions tab:

1. Go to **Actions → Scan Technology Stack → Run workflow**
2. Optionally enter a country code (leave blank to scan all countries)
3. Optionally adjust the rate limit

Artifacts uploaded after each run:

| Artifact | Contents |
|---|---|
| `tech-scan-<run_number>` | `data/metadata.db`, scan output log, annotated `*_tech.toon` files |

---

## Output

### Annotated TOON file

Each page entry in the output `*_tech.toon` file gains a `technologies` field:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.gov/",
  "is_root_page": true,
  "technologies": {
    "Nginx": { "versions": ["1.24"], "categories": ["Web servers"] },
    "WordPress": { "versions": ["6.2"], "categories": ["CMS", "Blogs"] }
  }
}
```

If detection failed for a URL, a `tech_error` field is added instead:

```json
{
  "url": "https://unreachable.gov/",
  "tech_error": "Connection error: ..."
}
```

### Database table

Results are stored in the `url_tech_results` table:

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | TEXT | Page URL |
| `country_code` | TEXT | Country identifier |
| `scan_id` | TEXT | Unique scan run ID |
| `technologies` | TEXT | JSON object of detected technologies |
| `error_message` | TEXT | Error message (if detection failed) |
| `scanned_at` | TEXT | ISO-8601 timestamp |

Query example:

```sql
SELECT url, technologies
FROM url_tech_results
WHERE country_code = 'ICELAND'
ORDER BY scanned_at DESC;
```

## Architecture

```
scan-technology.yml (GitHub Actions)
    ↓
scan_technology.py (CLI)
    ↓
TechScanner.scan_country()
    ↓
TechDetector.detect_urls_batch()
    ↓
For each URL:
    httpx.get()  →  HTML + headers
    Wappalyzer.analyze_with_versions_and_categories()
    ↓
Save to url_tech_results table
    ↓
Write *_tech.toon output file
```

## Notes

- **Rate limiting** is applied between requests to avoid overloading government
  servers.  The default is 2 requests per second.
- Technology fingerprinting is best-effort; some sites may return no detections
  if they use custom or obfuscated stacks.
- Unlike the URL validator, failed tech scans do **not** mark a URL for removal
  — errors are recorded but the URL is kept in future scan cycles.
- The `*_tech.toon` output files are excluded from version control (see
  `.gitignore`).
